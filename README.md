# FirebaseDemo
Just a small Android app to demonstrate parts of Firebase

NOTE: The configurationfiles point to my database! You need to create your own Firebase connection to actually use this app!

You may find more material, e.g., the presentation where the app is used to showcase Firebase (Realtime Database)
